# IT-Connect

Helping small businesses understand their software, reduce ongoing costs,
and avoid being locked into systems they don’t control.

## What I Do

Many small businesses feel stuck paying for software they don’t fully use
or don’t really like.

I help by reviewing what you’re using, explaining your options in plain
English, and helping you make informed decisions — with no pressure to
change anything.

## How It Works

- Review your current software and subscriptions
- Identify overlaps and unnecessary costs
- Explain safer or more flexible alternatives
- You decide what (if anything) to change
